# Introduction-to-Data-Engineering
## Discription
Learn about the world of data engineering, covering tools and topics like ETL and cloud computing
### 1.	Introduction to data engineering
Explore the differences between a data engineer and a data scientist, get an overview of the various tools data engineers use and expand your understanding of how cloud technology plays a role in data engineering.
*	Identify the tasks of a data engineer
*	What kind of tools they are
*	Cloud service providers
### 2.	Data engineering toolbox
Learn in detail about different types of databases data engineers use, how parallel computing is a cornerstone of the data engineer's toolkit, and how to schedule data processing jobs using scheduling frameworks.
*	Databases
* Parallel computing & frameworks (Spark)
*	Workflow scheduling with Airflow
### 3. Extract, Load and Transform (ETL)
Learn how to extract raw data from various sources, transform this raw data into actionable insights, and load it into relevant databases ready for consumption!
*	Extract: get data from several sources
*	Transform: perform transformations using parallel computing
*	Load: load data into target database
### 4. Case study [Notebook](https://github.com/cc59chong/Introduction-to-Data-Engineering/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Engineering%20-%20Case%20Study.ipynb)
Perform and schedule an ETL process that transforms raw course rating data, into actionable course recommendations for students!
* Fetch data from multiple sources
* Transform to form recommendations
* Load into target database
